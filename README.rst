Advent of Code

My solutions to Advent of Code. Mostly this is a project for me to learn golang. Don't take this code as an example of good golang. If you see a python version for one of the days, it's probably decent.

The files are organized into directories by date. If my approach to solving the problem warrants some explanation, I've included a readme in that directory.

Note that these solutions subscribe to the garbage in garbage out philosophy. My rationale is that these are pedagogical solutions to interesting problems, and not production-safe paragons of proper error checking.
